    <h1><strong>Authentic Nigerian Afang Soup Recipe</strong></h1>
<p>Afang soup is a rich, flavorful vegetable soup from Southern Nigeria, loved for its unique blend of fresh waterleaf and finely sliced okazi leaves. Slow-cooked with tender meat, stockfish, and a mix of traditional spices, it delivers a hearty, earthy taste that pairs perfectly with fufu, pounded yam, or eba. Popular among the Efik and Ibibio people, this nourishing dish is a celebration of culture and comfort in every bite.</p>
